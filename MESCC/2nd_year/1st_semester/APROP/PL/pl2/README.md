Run the following command
```
make init
```
This will simply to create a "bin" folder

## Build
To build the exercises:

```
make mmult
```
or
```
make mandel
```
or
```
make quicksort
```

## Running
To run the exercises:

```
./bin/mmult [num_threads]
```
or
```
./bin/mandel [num_threads]
```
or
```
./bin/quicksort [num_threads]

Note that num_threads is optional and will default to the defined DEFAULT_NUM_THREADS
