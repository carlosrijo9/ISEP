  abstractnote = {This paper presents a control allocation method for enhancing the attitude following performance and the energy efficiency of a variable-pitch propeller (VPP) system on quadrotor-based unmanned aerial vehicles. The VPP system was modeled according to the blade element momentum (BEM) theory, and an actuator allocation method was developed with the aim of enhancing the attitude control and energy performance. A simulation environment was built to validate the VPP system by creating a thrust and moment database from the experiments. A four-motor variable-pitch quadrotor was built for verifying the proposed method. The control allocation method was firstly verified in a simulation environment, and was then implemented in a flight controller for indoor flight experiments. The simulation results show the proposed control allocation method greatly improves the yaw following performance. The experimental results demonstrate a difference in the energy consumption through various pitch angles, as well as a reduction in energy consumption, by applying this VPP system.},

  title        = {Design and Control of an Autonomous Variable-Pitch Quadrotor Helicopter},
  abstractnote = {The aerospace community, particularly in academia, has seen a recent rise in the popularity of fixed-pitch quadrotor helicopters. The fixed-pitch quadrotor is popular largely because of its mechanical simplicity relative to other hovering aircraft. This simplicity, however, places fundamental limits on the achievable actuator bandwidth and the types of maneuvers possible to fly. This thesis explores the extent to which the addition of variable-pitch propellers to a quadrotor helicopter overcomes these limitations. A detailed analysis of the potential benefits of variable-pitch propellers over fixed-pitch propellers for a quadrotor is presented. This analysis is supported with experimental testing to show that variable-pitch propellers, in addition to allowing for efficient generation of negative thrust, substantially increase the maximum rate of thrust change. A nonlinear, quaternion-based control algorithm is presented for controlling the quadrotor. An accompanying trajectory generation method is detailed with an optimization routine for finding minimum-time paths through waypoints. The control law and trajectory generation algorithms are implemented in simulation and on a custom variable-pitch quadrotor. The quadrotor attitude control is performed on the vehicle using a custom autopilot. Position and attitude measurements are made with an off-board motion capture system. Several flight tests are shown with a particular emphasis on the benefits of a variable-pitch qaudrotor over a standard fixed-pitch quadrotor for performing aggressive and aerobatics maneuvers. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this work marks the first documented, autonomous variable-pitch quadrotor built for agile and aggressive flight.},

In this paper, 9 RTOSes targeting smaller processors have been evaluated and four of the RTOSes have been selected for performance benchmarking on the same M16/62P microcontroller platform to avoid bias. Based on the comparison, the μTKernel RTOS is chosen for porting to the H8S/2377 16-bit microcontroller to demonstrate the ease of RTOS platform migration. The same version of μTKernel RTOS running on different platforms are then compared. Lastly, an application is developed with the RTOS to demonstrate the ease of multi-task application development on such microcontroller platform.},

Speciﬁcally, we consider issues that result from the integration of complex requirements for embedded systems. Integration has been identiﬁed as a complex issue in various ﬁelds such as automotive, critical systems (aerospace, nuclear etc) and consumer electronics. In addition, the pressure on time-to-market, the emergence of multi-site development, and the ever-increasing size of software stacks are driving radical changes in the development approaches of modern applications. These complex requirements have placed greater requirements on Operating Systems with respect to how interfaces are deﬁned and how resources are managed. These requirements are expanded and justiﬁed through the course of this paper. The requirements are then discussed in the context of emerging solutions from a number of domains.},

  abstractnote = {Raising the abstraction level is widely seen as a solution to increase productivity, in order to handle the growing complexity of real-time embedded applications and the time-to-market pressures. In this context, the use of a real-time operating system (RTOS) becomes extremely important to the development of applications with real-time systems requirements. However, the use of a detailed RTOS at early design phases is a contra sense, and the existing system level description languages (SLDL) lack support for RTOS modeling at higher abstraction levels. In this paper, we introduce an abstract RTOS model, and a set of refinement steps that allows refining the abstract model to an implementation model at lower abstraction levels. This abstract RTOS model provides the main features available in a typical RTOS, permitting the designer to model parallel and concurrent behavior of real-time embedded applications at higher abstraction levels. We use SystemC language with some extensions to build the abstract RTOS model, allowing a quick evaluation of different scheduling algorithms and synchronization mechanisms at the early stage of system design. An experimental result with a telecom system that consists of fifty tasks with four priority levels shows the usefulness of this model.},

  title        = {Selection of RTOS for an Efficient Design of Embedded Systems},
  abstractnote = {Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is a basic building block of most of the Embedded Systems (ES). There are wide ranges of RTOS’s available to the designers/ developers of ES’s ranging from RTOS for robotics to home appliances. Each application demands a specialized set of requirements and to meet these requirements the designer needs to select the RTOS, which meets the desired requirements. It is a critical task for him/her and time consuming because it involves to know all the specifications of different RTOS and there are various RTOS’s available in the market that include micro kernels to commercial RTOS’s . So it is the task of the designer to select the suitable RTOS from the vast list of RTOS’s. The design space available to any RTOS is very large and there are countless set of characteristics such as Development Methodology, Scheduling Algorithms, Kind of Real Time (Soft of Hard), Priority Levels, Development Host, Standards followed, Kernel ROM size, Kernel RAM size, Multi process Support, Multiprocessor Support, Interrupt latency, Task Switching time, Kind of IPC mechanism, Memory management, Power management, Task management, Price etc. These characteristics will guide the designer for selecting the RTOS that meets the requirements. Selecting the RTOS based on these parameters is a multidimensional search problem with each dimension corresponds to a RTOS characteristic and it requires an exhaustive search with tremendous computing resources and time. In our framework of RTOS selection, we have used the Simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) with interactive GUI by which the developer can choose the right RTOS for a given application or a project efficiently.},

  abstractnote = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in the public and civil domains. These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.},

Second, in light of such characteristics, we provide an in-depth review of the existing M2M wireless technologies, considering both proprietary and open/standardized solutions for proximity-based, short-range and large-scale networks. Finally, we perform a critical comparison of the surveyed solutions over different M2M use cases and requirements, and we identify the research directions and open issues that still have to be addressed.},
