\glspl{uav} have witnessed a surge in popularity and research attention. 
They have become indispensable in various applications, ranging from surveillance to reconnaissance, due to their versatility and efficiency in various applications \cite{uav1}. 

This growing interest is evident in the numerous review papers exploring different aspects of \gls{uav} development, ranging from open-source hardware and software utilization \cite{uav2}, \cite{uav3},\cite{uav4}, frame design and optimization \cite{uav5}, \cite{uav6}, control systems, including both conventional and modern communication modalities such as 5G networks \cite{uav7}, \cite{uav8}, \cite{uav10}, \cite{uav11}, to efficient power management strategies, and alternative energy sources to extend \gls{uav} battery life \cite{uav15}.\\

Nowadays, most \gls{VTOL} \glspl{uav}, rely on proprotors with fixed pitch systems because of their simplicity and lack of better \gls{COTS} reliable and efficient solutions but they impose limitations on the achievable flight performance \cite{FPP1}.
Thrust generation is confined to a single direction, hindering the \gls{uav}'s ability to produce upward thrust relative to the vehicle body.
Additionally, the control bandwidth is restricted by the inertia of the motors and proprotors, constraining the \gls{uav}'s agility and maneuverability \cite{FPP1}.\\
As described in recent studies \cite{FPP1}, these limitations become more pronounced as \gls{uav} size increases, impacting stability and control. 
Larger \glspl{uav} face challenges as the need for larger motors with higher inertia compromises rapid control through \gls{RPM} adjustments alone.\\

The development of Variable Pitch Proprotor (VPP) systems plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations of traditional \gls{uav} designs, such as those with fixed pitch proprotors \cite{VPP1}, \cite{FPP1}.
Several detailed descriptions of quadrotors, for instance, modeling and dynamics have been published \cite{FPP2}, \cite{FPP3}, \cite{FPP4}, \cite{FPP5}, emphasizing the need for dynamic control mechanisms.\\
The use of VPP systems, especially in \gls{VTOL} \glspl{uav}, addresses challenges related to control instabilities and energy efficiency \cite{VPP1}.\\
The incorporation of variable-pitch proprotors provides the necessary flexibility to enhance stability and enable larger \glspl{uav} to perform sophisticated maneuvers, overcoming the constraints inherent in fixed-pitch designs \cite{VPP1}, \cite{FPP1}.

\section{Problem Analyses}
The utilization of fixed-pitch propellers in \glspl{uav} presents a set of limitations that significantly impact aircraft performance and efficiency.
These issues are evident in various phases of flight, including hover and forward flight, and have repercussions for the \gls{uav}.

\subsection{Maneuverability and Response}
Fixed-pitch propellers inherently constrain \glspl{uav} from adjusting the pitch angle during flight \cite{FPP1}. 
This limitation results in compromised maneuverability and response, restricting the range of aerobatic maneuvers that a \gls{uav} can execute \cite{FPP1}. 
Additionally, the inability to change the pitch angle impedes the optimization of lift, landing, and thrust during flight, leading to sub-optimal performance in various operational scenarios \cite{FPP1}.

\subsection{Power Consumption}
With fixed-pitch propellers, the power consumption will be higher.
Without the ability to adjust the propeller angle, \glspl{uav} may be forced to operate at higher \gls{RPM}s to compensate for this lack of adjustment \cite{FPP1}.
This higher power consumption not only affects the efficiency of the \gls{uav} but also has implications for its endurance, limiting the time the vehicle can remain airborne.\\
