\glspl{uav} have witnessed a surge in popularity and research attention.
They have become indispensable in various applications, ranging from surveillance to reconnaissance, due to their versatility and efficiency in various applications, possible to see in figure \ref{fig:uav_market1} \cite{UAV1}, \cite{UAV_market}.

This growing interest is evident in the numerous review papers exploring different aspects of \gls{uav} development, ranging from open-source hardware and software utilization \cite{UAV2}, frame design and optimization \cite{UAV5}, control systems, including both conventional and modern communication modalities such as 5G networks \cite{UAV7}, to efficient power management strategies, and alternative energy sources to extend \gls{uav} battery life \cite{UAV12}, \cite{UAV_market}. %, \cite{UAV3},\cite{UAV4} || \cite{UAV6} || , \cite{UAV8}, \cite{UAV10}, \cite{UAV11}

It is estimated that \gls{uav} market will grow at a \gls{CAGR} of 19.6\% and generate a revenue of 95012,76â‚¬ million by 2030 \cite{UAV_market}, \cite{UAV_market2}.
The graph illustrated in figure \ref{fig:uav_market2}, shows that this estimated growth is expected to occur worldwide \cite{UAV_market}.

Nowadays, most \gls{VTOL} \glspl{uav}, rely on proprotors with fixed pitch systems because of their simplicity and lack of better \gls{COTS} reliable and efficient solutions but they impose limitations on the achievable flight performance \cite{FPP1}.
Thrust generation is confined to a single direction, hindering the \gls{uav}'s ability to produce upward thrust relative to the vehicle body.
Additionally, the \glspl{uav} control is restricted by the inertia of the motors and proprotors, constraining the \gls{uav}'s agility and maneuverability \cite{FPP1}.
As described in recent studies \cite{FPP1}, these limitations become more pronounced as \gls{uav} size increases, impacting stability and control.
Larger \glspl{uav} face challenges as the need for larger motors with higher inertia compromises rapid control through \gls{RPM} adjustments alone.

The development of Variable Pitch Proprotor (VPP) systems plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations of traditional \gls{uav} designs, such as those with fixed pitch proprotors \cite{FPP1}, \cite{VPP1}.
Several detailed descriptions of quadrotors, for instance, modeling and dynamics have been published \cite{FPP2}, \cite{FPP3}, \cite{FPP4}, \cite{FPP5}, emphasizing the need for dynamic control mechanisms.
The use of VPP systems, especially in \gls{VTOL} \glspl{uav}, addresses challenges related to control instabilities and energy efficiency \cite{VPP1}.

The incorporation of variable-pitch proprotors provides the necessary flexibility to enhance stability and enable larger \glspl{uav} to perform sophisticated maneuvers, overcoming the constraints inherent in fixed-pitch designs \cite{FPP1}, \cite{VPP1}.
The graphs shown in figure \ref{fig:FPPvsVPP2} and \ref{fig:FPPvsVPP}, illustrate the differences between fixed-pitch and variable-pitch propellers (constant-speed in this graphs).

\end{figure}

It is possible to see that when the propeller reaches its maximum airspeed design point, there is little to no difference between the performance of the fixed-pitch and variable-pitch propellers.
The difference in performance and efficiency can be seen when the airspeed is below or above the maximum design point \cite{VPP9}.

This Thesis aims to develop a stand-alone variable-pitch proprotor system that can, in real-time, change the propeller pitch according to each flight phase.
This work will be integrated into a PhD Thesis that is currently being developed at Universidade da Beira Interior by Eng. Renato Machado about Urban Air Mobility.

\section{Problem Analysis}
The utilization of fixed-pitch propellers in \glspl{uav} presents a set of limitations that significantly impact aircraft performance and efficiency.
These issues are evident in various phases of flight, including hover and forward flight, and have repercussions for the \gls{uav}.

In terms of maneuverability and response, fixed-pitch propellers inherently constrain the \glspl{uav} from adjusting the pitch angle during flight \cite{FPP1}.
This limitation results in compromised maneuverability and response, restricting the range of aerobatic maneuvers that a \gls{uav} can execute \cite{FPP1}.
Additionally, the inability to change the pitch angle impedes the optimization of lift, landing, and thrust during flight, leading to sub-optimal performance in various operational scenarios \cite{FPP1}.

As for power consumption in systems with fixed-pitch propellers, the power consumption will be higher.
Without the ability to adjust the propeller angle, the \glspl{uav} may be forced to operate at higher \glspl{RPM} to compensate for this lack of adjustment \cite{FPP1}.
This higher power consumption not only affects the efficiency of the \gls{uav} but also has implications for its endurance, limiting the time the vehicle can remain airborne.

\section{Objectives}
As explained before, the focus will be on developing a stand-alone variable-pitch proprotor system.

The first goal will be the understanding of the relevant fundamentals regarding \gls{VTOL} flight performance and the impact of variable proprotors.

Next, describe the fundamentals of control subsystems, power management and short-range wireless communication protocols with particular emphasis on their reliability and real-time sensing and actuation.
There will also be made a survey about current solutions, communication technologies, electronic control and power management strategies.

After the research, it will be designed the subsystems architecture and then implemented the envisaged subsystem over a real mechanical prototype.

Finally, the performance of the system will be evaluated together with its limitations under different settings and environments.
